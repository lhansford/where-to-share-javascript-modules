# Where To Share Javascript Modules

When releasing new Javascript modules in the past I've been uncertain where to share and promote. This document contains such resources that I've found, and will hopefully be updated over time as I find more.

## General Javascript

### Package Registries

#### [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com)

You're probably hosting your package here already, but in case you're not, NPM is lkely the number one place to make your module discoverable.

### Newsletters

#### [Javascript Weekly](https://javascriptweekly.com/)

At the time I'm adding this, Javascript Weekly has over 500 issues and 170,000+ subscribers. They have a regular section highlighting new and updated JS modules.

## React

### Newsletters

#### [React Status](https://react.statuscode.com/)

Part of the same network as Javascript Weekly, React Status also has a regular section highlighting new and updated React modules.
